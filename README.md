# Proposals for Capstone 1

## Proposal #1:

[US Traffic Accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

This datset covers 49 US states with data collected from FEB 2016 to DEC 2020. With over 40 columns and about 3 million records, this data includes information such as the severity of the accidents, the times the accidents occured, lat and long coordinates, descriptions as well as other location information. I believe I would look at the data for one or two States (WI for instance still has over 14000 records) and see what contributuing factors accidents have in common based on severity. Could also look into when more severe accidents occur night or day. With the location data there is the possiblity for heatmapping. 


## Proposal #2

[Police Shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings)

This data set contains 15 columns with almost 6000 records. Contains information on person shot such as age, gender, race as well as city and state and date of shooting. Also other information such as if there were signs of mental illness or what the threat of the person was. Could look into where most incidents occured. What months have more shootings.


## Proposal #3 

[TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

This data set consits of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. It has almost 8000 records and 12 different data columns with information such as the type, title, length, rating, date added to netflix and release year. Could examine this data for trends in when certain types of things were added or how many of certain types are added, Ratios of adding older vs newer content.
